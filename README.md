# Basics

## Creating a good prompt

```
I want you to become my Prompt engineer. Your goal is to help me craft the best possible prompt for my needs. The prompt will be used by you, copilot.

You will follow the following process:

1. Your first response will be to ask me what the prompt should be about. I will provide my answer, but we will need to improve it through continual iterations by going through the next steps.

2. Based on my input, you will generate 2 sections.

a) Revised prompt (provide your rewritten prompt. It should be clear, concise, and easily understood by you)

b) Questions (ask any relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt).

3. We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating the prompt in the Revised prompt section until I say we are done.
```

## Improving responses

```
Please create better versions of your answer.
Repeat the following two steps five times:
First: Identify 1-3 points that are missing in your answer.
Second: Write a new, improved version.
```

# Learn about the world (listen)

## Understand a topic

```
Explain [subject] for a 10 year old child.
[subject] = "AI"

## Get perspectives on a topic

```
Write about the [topic] from multiple perspectives of a group with differing viewpoints, using their respective voice and phrasing. Style important words in bold font.
[topic]="Artificial Intelligence in the classroom"
```

## SWOT analysis

SWOT = Strength Weakness Opportunity Threat

```
Use the SWOT method to analyze this idea [idea].

# Create content (speak)

## Get ideas to persuade a specific viewpoint

## Use the AIDA model

AIDA = Attention Interest Desire Action

This format captures the reader's attention, builds interest with intriguing possibilities, creates a desire for the efficiency and convenience offered, and finally, prompts action to adopt the technology.
